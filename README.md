# WebScrapping_Save_scripts
 
The data folder contains all the hospital , In each Folder of hospital there are 4 files and 1 forlder

There are 3 python scripts 
 scrap.py
 
 This gets the file csv or xlsx from that hospital website and save it to a folder latest
 
 parse.py
 
 This parses that file in latest folder and make another csv file with three column as data-latest.csv
 
 save.py
 
 This saves that data-latest to my database
 
AFTER THIS THERE IS ANOTHER SCRIPT

runalll.py

This executes each script in sequence scrap ,parse and then save for each hospital.I only need to execute this file in command line and it will do everything.
